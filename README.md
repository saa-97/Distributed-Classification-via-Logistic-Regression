# Distributed-Classification-via-Logistic-Regression
The objective is to apply a Gradient Tracking algorithm to achieve consensus optimization across multiple agents. This will demostrate how distributed systems can collaborate to determine a nonlinear classifier for data points in a feature space.

## Task 1.1
1. Open file task_1.1_1.2
2. Set the variable Task1_1 to 1
3. You can set the following parameters as you wish from the file directly:
	- NN (number of agents)
	- alpha (learning rate)
	- MAXITERS (Maximum Iterations for the update steps)
	- graph_type (you can choose which type of graph you want among the agents from the following: "cycle", "path", "star", "complete")
4. Now run the python file
